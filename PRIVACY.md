BISmark-Passive Priacy Statement
================================

(This is still a draft.)

Summary
-------

BISmark-Passive collects specific, limited information about how and when
devices on your home network access services and domains on the Internet.
BISmark-Passive only collects the names and frequency of access to popular
Internet sites and services. **BISmark-Passive never records the contents of
your application sessions or any Personally Identifiable Information.**

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your participation
in BISmark-Passive, as well as how this information is used, disclosed, and
retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
BISmark-Passive before you agree to participate in the BISmark-Passive study.

Information we collect
----------------------

BISmark-Passive collects the following types of information about every device
that accesses the Internet using your BISmark router:

- We record the **manufacturer of each network device that accesses the Internet
  using your BISmark router.** We use this to differentiate between classes of
  devices, e.g., an iPad vs a desktop computer.
- We count **the number of times your devices communicate with popular Internet
  domains.** If desired, you can customize the list of destinations we monitor
  or completely disable this type of collection. We use this information to
  understand the frequency with which people access popular Internet sites.
- We record **the names of network applications your devices use, and the
  frequency with which your devices use these applications.** Examples of
  network applications are Web browsing, e-mail, instant messaging, and video
  chat. This information will help us understand the types of applications
  people most commonly use from their home network.
- We collect **anonymous traffic statistics.** We collect the size and timestamp
  of every packet sent through your BISmark router. We collect this information
  to better understand what "average" traffic looks like.

Although we believe it is unlikely, information collected by BISmark-Passive
could potentially be used to identify you in certain circumstances. You must
assess and accept the risks of participating in BISmark-Passive before you agree
to participate in the study.

Information we do not collect
-----------------------------

- **We do not record URLs.** For popular Web sites, we only record the name of
  the Web site. For example, if you watch a video on YouTube, we will record the
  fact that you visited YouTube, but nothing about the video you watched.
- **We do not record Personally Identifiable Information (PII).** We do not
  record your name, e-mail address, financial information, mailing address,
  birth date, or MAC or IP addresses except as described above.
- **We do not record packet contents.** We do not monitor the contents of
  e-mails, chat conversations, phone calls, file downloads, Web page contents,
  Internet login credentials, or anything else about your activities online
  except as described above.

BISmark-Passive does not install software on any of your network devices aside
from your BISmark router.

Examples
--------

- Suppose you watch a YouTube video on your laptop while it is *not* connected
  to your BISmark router. BISmark-Passive will not record any information in
  this case, since it only monitors activity through your BISmark router.
- Suppose you watch a YouTube video on your laptop while it is connected to your
  BISmark router. Because YouTube is on the list of popular sites,
  BISmark-Passive will record the fact that you visited YouTube; it will also
  record the amount of data of transferred between YouTube and your laptop, and
  the manufacturer of your laptop's network card. BISmark-Passive *will not*
  record the name or contents of the video you watched, your YouTube username or
  password or any cookies or other data associated with YouTube.
- Suppose you remove YouTube from the list of popular sites. Now
  BISmark-Passive will not record the fact that you visited YouTube. It will
  only record the broad category of service you accessed (e.g., Web browsing)
  and the size and timestamp of the packets sent to and from YouTube.

Information disclosure
----------------------

All of the information described above will be collected, maintained, and used
by the BISmark-Passive team. We may disclose this information outside of the
BISmark-Passive team in the following ways:
- The BISmark-Passive team will utilize the collected data to produce scholarly
  works such as articles, reports, and presentations that will be published and
  publicly accessible. These results will typically contain aggregated and
  derivative information, but may contain raw information, excluding PII.
- Any information collected as part of BISmark-Passive may potentially be
  disclosed in response to a lawful request by law enforcement or other legal
  processes or authorities.

Information retention
---------------------

All data collected by BISmark-Passive will be retained for the duration of the
study, or until you choose to terminate your participation in the study.

Information security
--------------------

We take measures to protect the information collected as described above. We
encrypt information as it is transmitted between the BISmark gateway and our
servers, or between your computer and our servers during enrollment. We have
implemented access controls to limit access to information stored on our
servers.
