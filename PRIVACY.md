BISmark-Passive Privacy Statement
=================================

(This is still a draft.)

Summary
-------

BISmark-Passive collects limited information about how and when devices on your
home network access the Internet. Specifically, it collects information about
the devices connected to your home network, the type and amount of network
traffic transferred by these devices, the domain names of popular Internet sites
accessed by these devices, and the frequency of such access.  **BISmark-Passive
never inspects or captures the contents of your network traffic.**

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your participation
in BISmark-Passive, as well as how this information is used, disclosed, and
retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
BISmark-Passive before you agree to participate in the BISmark-Passive study.

Information we collect, and why we collect it
---------------------------------------------

BISmark-Passive collects the following types of information about every device
that accesses the Internet using your BISmark router:

- BISmark-Passive records the manufacturer of each network device that accesses
  the Internet using your BISmark router by recording the first 3 bytes of each
  device's hardware identifier (MAC address). We use this information to
  differentiate between classes of devices (e.g. a video game console vs. a
  desktop computer).
- BISmark-Passive counts the number of times your devices communicate with
  popular Internet domains. We collect this information to understand the
  frequency with which people access popular Internet sites. The set of domains
  that are monitored is based on the Alexa "Top Sites" list
  (http://www.alexa.com/topsites), and you can alter this list of monitored
  domains, or completely disable this collection activity.
- BISmark-Passive records the types of network applications your devices use,
  and how frequently each application is used, by recording the quantity of
  network traffic associated with each TCP or UDP port number. We collect this
  information to understand the types of applications people commonly use from
  their home network. Examples of network applications include Web browsing,
  e-mail, instant messaging, and Skype.
- BISmark-Passive collects information about the distribution of network traffic
  by recording the size of each unit of information (packet) transmitted through
  your BISmark router, as well as the date and time at which the transmission
  occured. We collect this information to understand what an "average" home
  network traffic distribution looks like.

Although we believe it is unlikely, information collected by BISmark-Passive
could potentially be used to identify you in certain circumstances. You must
assess and accept the risks of participating in BISmark-Passive before you agree
to participate in the study.

Information we do not collect
-----------------------------

- **BISmark-Passive does not record URLs.** For popular Web sites, we only
  record the domain name of the Web site. For example, if you watch a video on
  YouTube, we will record the fact that you visited www.youtube.com, but not the
  specific URL of the video, which would indicate the video you watched.
- **BISmark-Passive does not record Personally Identifiable Information (PII).**
  We do not record your name, e-mail address, mailing address, MAC addresses or
  IP addresses except as described above and in the BISmark Privacy Statement.
  We never request or record financial information, social security numbers,
  birth dates, etc.
- **BISmark-Passive does not record application packet contents.** We do not
  monitor the contents of e-mails, chat conversations, phone calls, file
  downloads, Web page contents, Internet login credentials, or anything else
  about your online activities except as described above.

BISmark-Passive is installed on your BISmark router and does not affect or
install software on any of your personal network devices.

Examples
--------

- Suppose you watch a YouTube video on your laptop while it is *not* connected
  to your BISmark router. BISmark-Passive will not record any information in
  this case, since it only monitors activity through your BISmark router.
- Suppose you watch a YouTube video on your laptop while it is connected to your
  BISmark router. YouTube is on the list of popular sites, so BISmark-Passive
  will record the fact that you visited YouTube; it will also record the amount
  of data of transferred between YouTube and your laptop, and the manufacturer
  of your laptop's network card. BISmark-Passive *will not* record the name or
  contents of the video you watched, your YouTube username or password or any
  cookies or other data associated with YouTube.
- Suppose you remove YouTube from the list of popular sites. Now BISmark-Passive
  will not record the fact that you visited YouTube. It will only record the
  broad category of service you accessed (e.g., Web browsing) and the size and
  timestamp of the packets sent to and from YouTube.

Information disclosure
----------------------

All of the information described above will be collected, maintained, and used
by the BISmark-Passive team. We may disclose this information outside of the
BISmark-Passive team in the following ways:
- The BISmark-Passive team will utilize the collected data to produce scholarly
  works such as articles, reports, and presentations that will be published and
  publicly accessible. These results will typically contain aggregated and
  derivative information, but may contain raw information, excluding PII as
  noted in the BISmark Privacy Statement.
- Any information collected as part of BISmark-Passive may potentially be
  disclosed in response to a lawful request by law enforcement or other legal
  processes or authorities.

Information retention
---------------------

All data collected by BISmark-Passive will be retained for the duration of the
study, or until you choose to terminate your participation in the study.

Information security
--------------------

We take measures to protect the information collected as described above. We
encrypt information as it is transmitted between the BISmark gateway and our
servers, or between your computer and our servers during enrollment. We have
implemented access controls to limit access to information stored on our
servers.
